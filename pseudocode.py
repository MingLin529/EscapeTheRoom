# Story adopted from Yunxinghe

# Starting plot:
# You are John Anderson, an university student. You, who was supposed to
# return home to enjoy the summer vacation, were somehow trapped in this room.
# When a person wakes up and finds that the surrounding environment is
# strange, this is a very scary thing. As a senior YouTuber, you have seen
# animation since childhood and you with rich imagination have decided to face
# this problem alone. After some thoughts, you decide:


# Bad Endings:

# End 1-You died(Sounds too loud!):
# 1-watch YouTube
    # a. search for wifi
    # b. watch YouTube

# watch YouTube:
# It is indeed you, what a wise choice! You pulled out your phone, opened the
# YouTube client, and watched the video you downloaded the previous two days.
# Since there is no earphone, you can only put it outlaud. Your voice is so
# noisy that it attracts someone who shouldn't.


# End 2-Is it a dream?:
# 1-search for WiFi
    # a. search for WiFi
    # b. watch YouTube
# 2-(opition does not matter, both works)
    # a. turn on low battery mode to save battery
    # b. turn off the phone to save battery
# 3-leave the hair
    # a. leave the hair
    # b. take the black hair with you
# 4-lay back to bed
    # a. lay back to bed
    # b. lock the door

# search for wifi:
# It is indeed you that you decide to pull out your phone first and search for
# WiFi here. Unfortunately, there's no WiFi and not even a sign of signals
# here. Your phone has only 2% of battery left, also there are 83 missed calls.
# You open the call log. Most of these 83 missed calls are from your mother.
# The last call was at 8:07 last night. In other words, after 8:07 last night,
# you entered the no-signal zone. And the person kidnapped you didn't
# confiscate your phone. As a very important communication tool, mobile phones
# need to be handled properly. So you decide:

# turn on low battery mode to save battery:
# It is indeed you! You have decided to turn on your phone in energy-saving
# mode, so that if your phone enters the signal area, you can receive calls as
# soon as possible. You put your phone in your pocket.

# turn off the phone to save battery:
# It is indeed you that you decided to turn off your phone to save power. You
# are very worried that 2% of your battery will not last long. After you
# turned off your phone, you put it in your pocket.

# plot that connects after a and b choices of opition 2:
# And pay attention to the pattern on the wall. You have imagined a lot of
# scenes that will only appear in the game. If it is the same as in the game,
# then this is a magic circle. Dense and complex text is written at the bottom
# of the array. On the ground in front of the array, an incense burner and two
# dishes are placed. White hair and black hair are separately placed on the
# left and right dishes. After some consideration, you decide:

# leave the hair:
# It is indeed you, your keen thinking immediately made you judge. This array
# faintly reveals an unknown atmosphere, it is better not to touch it.
# You naturally took a few steps back.

# plot that connects after a and b choices of opition 3:
# Just then suddenly footsteps came from outside the door. You got closer,
# the footsteps were laid back, probably from the owner of the house. The
# steps became clearer and clearer, and it was clearly moving towards your
# room. What to do?

# lay back to bed:
# It is indeed you, you quickly figured out a way. We can pretend to
# sleep until she leaves, then we will have another chance to act.
# Was she the one who kidnapped me? It was incredible that she was a
# white-haired old woman. Just as then, you seem to smell a strange smell
# It was that incense! She has lit the three-pillar incense. Then you
# lost your awareness. After waking up, you find that you are lying
# in the hospital. Was everything just a dream? Your mother told you
# that you were in a coma due to anemia. When the police found you,
# you layed in an unnoticeable corner of a station. In short, your body has
# no big deal, but there is a bloody-red mole on your face.

# It is indeed you, your keen thinking immediately made you judge, this
# black hair must be the key to ruining this array. In this way, no
# matter what kind of magic this magic array is going to cast, it can
# be regarded as destroying one of the conditions. You are thinking so.

# plot that connects after a and b choices of opition 3:
# Just then suddenly footsteps came from outside the door. You got closer,
# the footsteps were laid back, probably from the owner of the house. The
# steps became clearer and clearer, and it was clearly moving towards your
# room. What to do?

# lock the door:
# It is indeed you who came up with such a bold action in such a short
# period of time. Yes, who said you can't lock the door of someone
# else's house. This can delay time as well as delay time. The door was
# locked, but where can I leave without leaving through the door? Your
# eyes moved to the window, and a bold idea came into being:

# jump down the window:
# This is an old-fashioned window, common in the last century.
# Unexpectedly, you start to wonder if you have actually been abducted.
# As wanting to trap me in the house, why not lock the windows and door?
# Anyways, no time to care that much. It is indeed you! The use of curtains
# as an elevator, this high-end technique, has only been seen on TV before,
# it is still difficult to operate in practice. Fortunately, this bungalow
# is not high, and there are cluttered and soft lawns on the ground.
# It may not be too painful to fall. Just then, a dog howling at you fiercely
# and ran towards you. Before you landed, you are bitten.

# flip through the window to next door:
# to be continue...
