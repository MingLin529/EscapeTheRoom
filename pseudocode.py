# Story adopted from Yunxinghe

# Starting plot:
# You are John Anderson, an university student. You, who was supposed to
# return home to enjoy the summer vacation, were somehow trapped in this room.
# When a person wakes up and finds that the surrounding environment is
# strange, this is a very scary thing. As a senior YouTuber, you have seen
# animation since childhood and you with rich imagination have decided to face
# this problem alone. After some thoughts, you decide:

# Bad Endings:

# End 1-You died(Sounds too loud!):
# 1-watch YouTube
    # a. search for wifi
    # b. watch YouTube

# watch YouTube:
# It is indeed you, what a wise choice! You pulled out your phone, opened the
# YouTube client, and watched the video you downloaded the previous two days.
# Since there is no earphone, you can only put it outlaud. Your voice is so
# noisy that it attracts someone who shouldn't.

# End 2-Is it a dream?:

    # a. leave the hair
    # b. take the black hair with you
# 4-lay back to bed
    # a. lay back to bed

# search for wifi:
# It is indeed you that you decide to pull out your phone first and search for
# WiFi here. Unfortunately, there's no WiFi and not even a sign of signals
# here. Your phone has only 2% of battery left, also there are 83 missed calls.
# You open the call log. Most of these 83 missed calls are from your mother.
# The last call was at 8:07 last night. In other words, after 8:07 last night,
# you entered the no-signal zone. And the person kidnapped you didn't
# confiscate your phone. As a very important communication tool, mobile phones
# need to be handled properly. So you decide:

# turn on low battery mode to save battery:
# It is indeed you! You have decided to turn on your phone in energy-saving
# mode, so that if your phone enters the signal area, you can receive calls as
# soon as possible. You put your phone in your pocket.

# turn off the phone to save battery:
# It is indeed you that you decided to turn off your phone to save power. You
# are very worried that 2% of your battery will not last long. After you
# turned off your phone, you put it in your pocket.

# plot that connects after a and b choices of opition 2:
# And pay attention to the pattern on the wall. You have imagined a lot of
# scenes that will only appear in the game. If it is the same as in the game,
# then this is a magic circle. Dense and complex text is written at the bottom
# of the magic circle. On the ground in front of the magic circle, an incense
# burner and two dishes are placed. White hair and black hair are separately
# placed on the left and right dishes. After some consideration, you decide:
